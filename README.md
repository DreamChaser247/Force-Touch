# Force-Touch
Force-Touch allows you control your mouse pointer by moving your hand in front of a camera. Very wizardy!

# Instalation
#### You need Python 3.12 at most to run this, because of Mediapipe not being compatible with Python 3.13

If you already have a compatible version of Python `cd` into the folder with the files, and create a virtual enviroment with a compatible version of Python

`python3.12 -m venv env`

replace "python3.12" with whatever command runs the compatible version of python, and run

`source env/bin/activate` 

to activate the virtual enviroment. Install the reqired libraries

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

now you can run the script *(remember to replace "python3.12" with whatever command runs the compatible version of python)*

`python3.12 Force-Touch.py`

And may the force be with you!
